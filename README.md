# Banknote Authenticity Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from kaggle
# Overview
The Banknote Authenticity dataset contains information about various features of banknotes, along with a label indicating whether each banknote is genuine or counterfeit. 
This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data mining research to develop and evaluate algorithms for detecting counterfeit currency.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 1500 rows and 7 columns:

is_genuine: Boolean indicating whether the banknote is genuine (True) or counterfeit (False).
diagonal: Length of the diagonal of the banknote image (float).
height_left: Height of the banknote image on the left side (float).
height_right: Height of the banknote image on the right side (float).
margin_low: Measure of the lower margin of the banknote image (float).
margin_upper: Measure of the upper margin of the banknote image (float).
length: Length of the banknote image (float).

# Project Ideas
Predicting Missing Values:
Use linear regression or a KNN imputer to predict missing values in the dataset. This can help improve the quality of the data for further analysis.
Classification vs. Unsupervised Learning:
Compare classification algorithms such as logistic regression or KNN with unsupervised learning models like K-Means clustering to predict the authenticity of the banknotes. 
Evaluate the performance of each approach and determine which one works best for this task.
Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:
Explore dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Kernel Transform to create a clearer separation between genuine and fake banknotes. 
Visualize the reduced-dimensional space and analyze how well it captures the underlying structure of the data.
# Implementation
You can load the dataset into your preferred machine learning framework or programming environment (e.g., Python with scikit-learn) to implement the aforementioned projects and analyses. 
Consider using Jupyter Notebooks or similar tools for an interactive and collaborative analysis experience.
